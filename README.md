Shared Imports

To solve the problems effectively, the following Python libraries are used throughout:

import csv
import json
import re
import os

Problems and Solutions

Problem 1: String Length

	•	Description: Calculate the length of a given string.
	•	Solution: Use len() function to determine string length.

Problem 2: Field Count in CSV

	•	Description: Count the number of fields in a comma-separated string.
	•	Solution: Use str.split(",") to split the string and len() to count fields.

Problem 3: Conditional String Check

	•	Description: Check if a string contains “silly” and is at most 50 characters long.
	•	Solution: Use str.find() and len().

Problem 4: Unicode Emoji Concatenation

	•	Description: Concatenate emoji characters using Unicode codes.
	•	Solution: Use chr() to convert codes to characters.

Problem 5: String Replacement

	•	Description: Replace specific substrings within a string.
	•	Solution: Use str.replace() for chained replacements.

Problem 6: TSV Parsing with Integer Conversion

	•	Description: Parse a TSV file, converting values to integers or None if conversion fails.
	•	Solution: Use csv.DictReader and try-except for error handling.

Problem 7: Enhanced TSV Parsing with Flags

	•	Description: Add a finagled flag if any value fails integer conversion.
	•	Solution: Extend Problem 6 by adding a flag to the parsed dictionary.

Problem 8: TSV Column Filtering

	•	Description: Write a TSV file containing only specific columns from the input file.
	•	Solution: Use csv.DictWriter for selective column output.

Problem 9: Count Rows in TSV

	•	Description: Count the number of rows with data in a TSV file.
	•	Solution: Use sum() on a generator iterating over rows.

Problem 10: Validate TSV Format

	•	Description: Verify if a file is formatted as a valid TSV file.
	•	Solution: Check consistency of column counts across lines.

Problem 11: Format Numbers in Strings

	•	Description: Format numbers in an f-string with commas and decimal precision.
	•	Solution: Use f-string formatting options.

Problem 12: Extract Floating Point from CSV

	•	Description: Extract the first floating-point number from a CSV line.
	•	Solution: Use str.split() and float().

Problem 13: List Column Names in CSV

	•	Description: Return a list of column names from a CSV file.
	•	Solution: Use csv.DictReader.fieldnames.

Problem 14: Extract Column Values

	•	Description: Extract all values from a specific column in a CSV file.
	•	Solution: Use a generator to retrieve values by column name.

Problem 15: JSON Key Lookup

	•	Description: Return the value for a specific key in a JSON file.
	•	Solution: Use json.load() and dictionary methods.

Problem 16: Compute Column Averages

	•	Description: Calculate averages for all numeric columns in a TSV file.
	•	Solution: Use a helper function and list comprehensions.

Problem 17: Check CSV Column Existence

	•	Description: Verify if specific columns exist in a CSV file.
	•	Solution: Use all() with DictReader.fieldnames.

Problem 18: Find Row by Value

	•	Description: Return the first row in a TSV file where a column matches a value.
	•	Solution: Use csv.DictReader and dict.get().

Problem 19: Fix Bug in List Indexing

	•	Description: Correctly handle cases where lists have fewer than 10 entries.
	•	Solution: Add a conditional check on list length.

Problem 20: File Existence Check

	•	Description: Find files matching a specific naming pattern in the current directory.
	•	Solution: Use os.path.isfile() with formatted filenames.

Usage Instructions

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/problem-solving-python.git
cd problem-solving-python


	2.	Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
	3.	Run individual scripts or problems as required:

python problem_script.py


	4.	Test file-dependent problems using the included sample files or provide your own.

Key Concepts Covered

	•	File Operations: Reading and writing CSV/TSV files with csv module.
	•	String Manipulation: Use of methods like split, replace, and find.
	•	Data Parsing: Handling JSON and TSV data formats.
	•	Error Handling: Using try-except for robust data parsing.
	•	List Comprehensions: Efficient data extraction and transformation.
	•	Custom Functions: Modular approach to problem-solving.
	•	Unicode and Formatting: Working with chr, ord, and f-strings.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Python in solving diverse computational problems.
